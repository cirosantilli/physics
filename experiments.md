    Yes, you can use lasers to cool atoms. Used to generate Bose Einstein condensates.

## Piezoelectric

## Quantum

-   Black body radiation catastrophe solved by quantization of energy.

-   Photoelectric effect: light intensity does not matter to take electrons out of a metal, only frequency.

    Below a certain frequency, nothing happens, then electrons start popping out.

    Explanation: photons are discrete.

    Nowadays we can use very high intensities, and some electrons will come out, because there are so many that multiple ones can interact at the same time.

-   Double slit with one electron.

    Stern-Gerlach.

    Surprising to see the three magnet case vertical, horizontal, vertical.

-   Compton scattering. TODO

    Really quick video without much explanation: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP8HmnuUFjA>

    Medium detailed setup, but looks not too complex. Hardest part must be the caesium.

### Particle
