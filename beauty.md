Light is quantized.

Superconductivity. A completely different level of conductivity, caused by a super hard to predict electron coupling effect.

## Newtonian gravitation

An elephant and a piece of paper fall at the same speed without air. 13 year olds without physics training don't know that!

## Atom

Electron charge is quantized.

Atoms exist.

There are neutrons and protons.

## Quantum mechanics

Unbelievably counter intuitive but precise and practically useful measurements!

Matter behaves as waves. Throw one million electrons at a wall with double slit, and in the end you see an interference pattern!

In certain systems energy is quantized! This explains the energy levels observed in atoms.

Explains chemical bonds. How do atoms stick together to form molecules? Covalent bonds, etc.

With statistical physics, explains semiconductors! Learn about the [energy bands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_band_structure).

## Relativity

Counter intuitive.

Special:

-   It is impossible to go faster than light.

    It is impossible to measure anything faster than light. Even if you are on a moving car towards the light.

-   Matter can be converted into energy and vice versa.

    Applications to nuclear reactions.

-   GPS

General:

-   explain gravity

-   black holes.

    Not even light that goes in a certain radius cannot come out.

    In 1974, Hawkins showed that the black hole does emit some radiation because of quantum field theory effects.

-   neutron stars

-   cosmic background radiation

## Standard model

There are 4 types of forces:

- strong
- weak
- electromagnetic
- gravitational

The standard model unifies strong, weak and electromagnetic into a single system.

The standard model is a quantum field theory.

Explains the spin of particles.

## Astronomy

The Earth is round. Radius estimate experience by Erastosthenes by using shadow lengths: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#Measurement_of_the_Earth.27s_circumference> He came up with it after he read by chance

Unlike for liquids, density is not the only factor to determine who goes up and down: particle size also matters, and big particles go up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dshv6bNcIKU
